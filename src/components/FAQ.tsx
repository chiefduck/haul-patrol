      icon: CreditCard,
      question: "What forms of payment do you accept?",
      answer: "We accept cash, all major credit cards, Venmo, and Zelle. Payment is due upon completion of the job. No upfront deposits required!"
    },
    {
      icon: Shield,
      question: "Are you licensed and insured?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Haul Patrol is fully licensed and insured. We carry comprehensive liability insurance to protect your property and our crew during every job."
    },
    {
      icon: Recycle,
      question: "What do you do with the junk you haul away?",
      answer: "We're committed to eco-friendly disposal. We donate usable items to local charities, recycle materials whenever possible, and only send truly unusable items to the landfill as a last resort."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you determine pricing?",
      answer: "Pricing is based on the volume of junk (how much space it takes in our truck). We offer free estimates over the phone or in person. Our $150 starting price covers smaller loads, and we'll never surprise you with hidden fees."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to be present during the haul?",
      answer: "Not necessarily! As long as you clearly mark what needs to go and we have access, you can be anywhere. Many customers leave us a key or garage code and return to a clutter-free space."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can you come out?",
      answer: "We offer same-day and next-day service in most cases. Call us by noon for potential same-day pickup. We know your time is valuable!"
